        <li><p id="seventy-content">King followed her first solo alum <em>Writer</em> in 1971 with <em>Tapestry</em>, which featured new compositions as well as reinterpretations of "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" and "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman". The album was recorded concurrently with Taylor's Mud Slide Slim, with an overlapping set of musicians including King, Danny Kortchmar and Joni Mitchell. Both albums included "You've Got a Friend", which was a number 1 hit for Taylor; King said in a 1972 interview that she "didn't write it with James or anybody really specifically in mind. But when James heard it he really liked it and wanted to record it".
        <br><br>  
        <em>Tapestry</em> was an instant success. With numerous hit singles – including a Billboard No.1 with "It's Too Late" – <em>Tapestry</em> held the No.1 spot for 15 consecutive weeks, remained on the charts for nearly six years, and has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. The album garnered four Grammy Awards including Album of the Year; Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female; Record of the Year ("It's Too Late", lyrics by Toni Stern); and Song of the Year, with King becoming the first woman to win the award ("You've Got a Friend"). The album appeared on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list at number 36. In addition, "It's Too Late" was number 469 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.</p></li>
