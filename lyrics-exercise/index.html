        You ought to know that <span>I think we're one and the same</span>
        <br>
        I don't think we could help it, no, I don't think we could help it
        <br>
        We don't talk much, guess 'cause nothing has changed
        <br>
        <span>And I'm not sure I like it, and I'm so tired of fighting</span>

        <br>
        You know me, you better show me that <span>you could say it to my face</span>
        <br>
        'Cause you know <span>we're the same,</span> there's worse things I can take

        I know you hate it when there's nothing to say
        <br>
        I'm not quite sure wе'd fix it, guess <span>we're so usеd to it</span>
        <br>
        <span>Wish I had known this from the beginning</span>
        <br>
        We'd find it hard to work out, why we have all this doubt
