        <h1>Hi</h1>
        <ol>
        <li> My name is Krissy Gatuslao. I am a junior in Communication Design with a minor in AMCS.</li>
        <li>I come from an artsy background where I attended a high school for the arts.
            But in college, I came to really enjoy design. Along with this class being a requirement for
            Communication Design, I was hoping to expand my portfolio and learn a new skill.</li>
        <li>I don't have any experience in HTML/CSS/JS, but I did take CSE 131 in freshman year. I'm not sure
            if I remember much from it though.</li>
        <li>I hope to learn basic HTML/CSS/JS as well as establish a good foundation in interaction design.</li>
        <li>Responsiveness really distinguishes screen from paper. You have to make sure that your content is viewable 
            and consistent for different screen sizes.</li>
        <li>I think that the <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> website exemplifies effective design because it combines unique typefaces, 
            illustrations, and a warm color pallete to create a welcoming and personable experience for the user.</li> 
        <li>The <a href="https://www.converse.com/">Converse</a> website has effective communication. It features appealing photography along with a clean cut font. The 
            website is predictable, making it efficient in getting its point across.</li> 
        <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a>'s website works well. It's organized with each section (i.e. stories, posts, suggestions) having its own place. 
            The website isn't cluttered. There's room to breath.</li>
